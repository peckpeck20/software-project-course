// Front-end

1. lists current list of candidates from back-end on the front-end.

2. polls every 3 seconds for changes in back-end list

3. allows for adding new candidates to the back-end. Kept in file system. (And thus
in max 3 seconds to front-end as well!)

4. gives possibility to reset the candidate list to the original list

5. modules etc. put nicely to separate files and folders

6. Fetch API used for AJAX.



// Back-end provides the needed Web Service API:

- candidates (GET, lists them as JSON)
- addCandidate (POST, tries to add new candidate based on sent JSON)
- checkIfNameExists (POST, will check how many times a first name appears in back-end list. No front-end for this implemented)
- resetCandidateList (GET, resets list to the candidates-original.json list)



// Missing still:

- routing inside React SPA
- utilizing HttpStatus codes better, like 504 server timeout. Now just success and failure separated from each other.
