Install Node.js (npm is included in Node.js installation)

create a folder for app if needed, e.g. my_node_app

npm init in that folder

go in that folder in WinSCP

copy & paste all given back-end files there. package.json gives you hint where the paste happens. Replace files if asked.

This time there is no need to install additional at backend. At least:
npm install express
npm install body-parser

node server44444.js            (or similar) 

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Remember to change at least the port number and url part 44444 everywhere
to your port number!

This code is tested and ran. In Windows + proto372 + images are from Myy.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxx

Happy hacking and exploring! 

If you don't get it running, you can analyze the code. it works.
