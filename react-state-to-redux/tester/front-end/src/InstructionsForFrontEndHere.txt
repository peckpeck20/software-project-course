Install Node.js (npm is included in Node.js installation)

Install create-react-app with npm

Create a new app, e.g. candidates-ajax with create-react-app

(((Template project had 2017-11-11 
21 304 files in 3 092 folders, altogether 145 MB. Making copy
from same SSD to itself took 2,5 mins. So 20 times more
over network?)))


go in that folder in file explorer

copy & paste ALL given front-end files/folders there in the same folder (src?). 
App.js and index.css give you hint where the single paste happens. Replace those
when asked.

This time there was no need to install additional packages, I think?
At least I cannot remember ever running any npm install (Not IN FRONT-END!!!,
in back-end on proto yes!)

Remember to change at least the port number and url part 44444 everywhere
to your port number!

This code is tested and ran. In Windows + proto372 + images are from Myy.

Happy hacking and exploring!
